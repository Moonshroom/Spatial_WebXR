 # Prototype application that tests the possibilities of WebXr technology in spatial planning 
 ---
  ## Overall description 
 ***
 The aim of the work was to investigate the possibilities of **WebXR** technology in the field of **spatial planning**. The resulting application presents the potential of **visualization** and analysis of **geospatial data** in **virtual and augmented reality environments**. The application functions as a website. It contains four VR examples that enable virtual tour of three-dimensional models representing various areas of the city of Poznań. It also has two AR examples for loading models via a smartphone camera. A working application can be found at [**this link**](https://moonshroom.github.io/Spatial_WebXR/).
 ## Set up and installation
 ***
 * The source code can be downloaded from [Github repository](https://github.com/Moonshroom/Spatial_WebXR)
 * When using the application, it is recommended to use devices such as a smartphone (intended for AR and VR) and specialized VR goggles i.e. Oculus Quest, HTC Vive (for examples related to VR)
 * When editing the source code or in order to test the application locally via a PC, it is recommended to use the plug-in for web browsers called [WebXR API Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje)
 * When using the application via a smartphone, it is recommended to download [Google AR Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=pl&gl=US)
 ## Technologies 
 The following libraries were used to create the application:
 * [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
 * [CanvasUI](https://github.com/NikLever/CanvasUI)
 * [WebXR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/)
 The following software was used to create 3D models representing areas of the city of Poznań:
 * [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and extension [BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS)
 * [QGIS 3.20](https://qgis.org/pl/site/) and plugin [Qgis2Threejs](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Qgis2threejs/) 

 ***
 ## Data used
 ***
The spatial data used in the app comes from:
* [SIP Geopoz Poznań](http://sip.geopoz.pl/sip/)
* Google Earth Engine
 ## Usage and possibilities
 ***
 The application has been tested in the area of ​​usability and suitability using the SUS scale and in the context of suitability in the spatial planning process. Potential applications are:
 * Social partycypation
 * Remote field inventory
 * Presentation of the planned scale of the investment
 * Real time modelling in VR 
 * Verification of the assumptions of the city plan
 * Analysis and visualization of 3D models and spatial data
 * SmartCity
